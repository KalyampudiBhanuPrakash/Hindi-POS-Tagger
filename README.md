# Hindi-POS-Tagger

This project implements a Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagger for Hindi using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and the Viterbi Algorithm. The tagger is designed to assign accurate part-of-speech tags to each word in a given Hindi sentence, facilitating further linguistic analysis and natural language processing tasks.

Hidden Markov Model (HMM): This probabilistic model is used to represent the sequence of POS tags. It captures the probabilities of transitions between tags and the likelihood of a word given a tag.

Viterbi Algorithm: This dynamic programming algorithm is utilized to find the most probable sequence of POS tags for a given sentence, based on the HMM.
